	<h2>Instructions</h2>

	<h3>Contributing to Juniper</h3>
	<p>We are always looking to improve the Juniper project. New components will be added and we are keen to improve the codebase over time. We will not be committed to backwards compatability between major releases.</p>
	<p>If you build something with Juniper, and create a component that may be useful to others, we'd love to include it! <a href="">Open an issue on Github</a></p>

	<h3>Getting started</h3>
	<p>You should use the production <code><a href="https://github.com/humanmade/hm-pattern-library/tree/gh-pages">gh-pages</a></code> branch. We reccommend either downloading the releases or using a submodule.</p>
	<p><b>Juniper CSS.</b> For simple projects, you can just load the compiled CSS files directly in your page.</p>
	<p><b>Juniper SASS.</b> For more complex projects, you can include the SCSS files at the top of your SCSS file. You will need to define the project path so that images load correctly. See the example SCSS file below.</p>
	<pre class="language-scss">
	// Define image path, relative to your project's main SASS file.
	$hm-images: "./../../../vendor/hm-pattern-library/assets/images";

	// Include the Juniper SASS file.
	@import "./../../../vendor/hm-pattern-library/assets/sass/style";

	// Your custom styles here.
	</pre>
	<p><b>JavaScript.</b> We aim to keep the JS as lightweight as possible, without any dependencies. You can include the <code>app.min.js</code> file in your project for a few nice little extra features such as collapsable navigaton. The JS is completely optional.</p>
	<p><b>Fonts.</b> The primary fonts used by Juniper are Proxima Nova for headings and FF Meta for body copy. These are served by Typekit and if you wish to use them you will need to add the Typekit JS to your page, and either create a new Kit, or add your domain to the Juniper kit settings.
